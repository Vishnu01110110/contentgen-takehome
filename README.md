# AI-Powered Product Description Generator

## Backend Changes
- Restructured codebase to use latest OpenAI API for future-proofing
- Updated FastAPI dependencies and related packages to most recent versions
- Implemented robust error handling for all API calls
- Added missing endpoints required by test cases
- Ensured proper response structures for all content types
- Configured for deployment on Render cloud platform

## Prompt Engineering Approach
My approach to prompt engineering focused on creating effective, iterative prompts:

1. Started with simple structures and progressively refined them based on test results
2. Created role-specific prompts (e.g., "eCommerce copywriter," "SEO specialist")
3. Structured each prompt with clear sections for product details and output expectations
4. Tailored formats for different content types (descriptions, SEO, marketing emails)
5. Added specific formatting instructions to ensure consistent, parsable outputs

## Deployment Notes
- Backend hosted on Render
- Frontend deployed via GitHub Pages
- Made configuration adjustments to ensure smooth cross-origin communication
- Added environment variable support for secure API key management

The frontend components were already in place, requiring minimal changes beyond connecting to the API endpoints and handling image generation tasks.

PS: Total time worked was around 3–4 hours. Sorry, I was sick last week and caught up with a lot of other work, so I didn’t have time to complete this. I was really excited about this opportunity and tried to start multiple times, but I couldn’t get to it. I truly wish I had more time last week to do more.
